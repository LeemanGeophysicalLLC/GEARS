# What to Bring
For the course we'll be providing most of the equipment and facilities necessary, but there
are a few items that we request you provide for yourself. If you have an issue providing any
of these, please contact us and arrangements can be made for an equipment loan.

## Required
* Laptop (Mac or Windows)
* Safety Glasses - no your regular glasses don't count. Must be ANSI approved safety eyeware and must be worn at all times in the shop.
* Closed shoes - open toe/heel footwear is not allowed in the shop
* Leather work gloves - you should have a pair anyway, but having your own gloves can be nice and helps keep your hands safe. Thanks to COVID we'd rather not all share the same gloves!
* Positive Attitude - this is a get and give course. We expect you to be active participants in discussions, activities, and general fun that we're sure to have. Also Siloam is a great town to explore in the evenings, so comfy shoes, etc.

## Optional
Have a project you're working on? A sensor you're struggling with? Some National Instruments
hardware that won't behave? A broken antenna mast that needs welded? Bring it! We'll have some
project time and bringing along something that's bugging you will help you maximize what you
can get from this course!
