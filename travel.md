# Travel and Lodging

The workshop will be held in beautiful Northwest Arkansas at the Leeman Geophysical facility.
[Siloam Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_Springs,_Arkansas) (where you will stay)
is a great small town and has many options for food, entertainment, and outdoors activities.
[Gentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry,_Arkansas) (where the facility is) is a nice
rural setting about 10 minutes from Siloam Springs by car.
No public transportation is available in the area.

**We recommend arriving Sunday November 5th and departing Friday evening or Saturday morning.**

## Travel
We recommend travel into the Northwest Arkansas National Airport (KXNA). Sometimes you'll hear
it called Highfill, Bentonville, Rogers, or Fayetteville - but as long as it is XNA you'll come
to the right spot! We will provide a ride from the airport to the hotel for you, just be sure
to send us your flight details at john@leemangeophysical.com. We will also be providing rides
to the airport for departure.

## Lodging
We recommend the [Hampton Inn](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/fyvsshx-hampton-siloam-springs/)
in Siloam Springs. The hotel is within
walking distance of many eateries, convenience stores, and a WalMart. We will shuttle you to
and from the workshop if needed. When booking call the local number (479) 215-1000. **DO NOT** press
the first option for new reservations. Stay on the line for the operator and tell them you are with
the GEARS workshop for our better nightly rate. If you press the new reservation option you end
up at a national call center that has no idea what GEARS is.
