# Travel and Lodging

The workshop will be held in beautiful Northwest Arkansas at the Leeman Geophysical facility
and neighboring building. [Siloam Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_Springs,_Arkansas)
is a great small town and has many options for food, entertainment, and outdoors activities.

## Travel
We recommend travel into the Northwest Araknsas National Airport (KXNA). Sometimes you'll hear
it called Highfill, Bentonville, Rogers, or Fayetteville - but as long as it is XNA you'll come
to the right spot! We will provide a ride from the airport to the hotel for you, just be sure
to send us your flight details at gears@leemangeophysical.com.

## Lodging
A block of rooms has been reserved at the [Hampton Inn](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/fyvsshx-hampton-siloam-springs/)
in Siloam Springs. Just call and tell them you're with the GEARs program. The hotel is within
walking distance of many eateries, convenience stores, and a WalMart. We will shuttle you to
and from the workshop, though if the weather is pleasant, you may enjoy the 15-20 minute walk
as well. Just let us know so the vans are not waiting on you!

## Food
Breakfast and dinner are on your own. There are many eateries within walking distance of the
hotel. We've listed them below as well as some that are further away, but also good choices.
Uber is alive and well in Siloam, as is GrubHub. Lunch will be provided at the workshop.
