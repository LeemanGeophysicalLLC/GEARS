# Travel and Lodging

The workshop will be held in beautiful Northwest Arkansas at the Leeman Geophysical facility
and neighboring building. [Siloam Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_Springs,_Arkansas)
is a great small town and has many options for food, entertainment, and outdoors activities.

**We recommend arriving Sunday afternoon August 1st and departing Friday evening.**

## Travel
We recommend travel into the Northwest Arkansas National Airport (KXNA). Sometimes you'll hear
it called Highfill, Bentonville, Rogers, or Fayetteville - but as long as it is XNA you'll come
to the right spot! We will provide a ride from the airport to the hotel for you, just be sure
to send us your flight details at john@leemangeophysical.com. We will also be providing rides
to the airport for departure.

## Lodging
A block of rooms has been reserved at the [Hampton Inn](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/fyvsshx-hampton-siloam-springs/)
in Siloam Springs. Just call and tell them you're with the GEARs program. The hotel is within
walking distance of many eateries, convenience stores, and a WalMart. We will shuttle you to
and from the workshop, though if the weather is pleasant, you may enjoy the 15-20 minute walk
as well. Just let us know so the vans are not waiting on you!
